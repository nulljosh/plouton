# Talli

BC income-assistance tracker. Free. Web, iOS, macOS and watchOS. Versions live in App Store Connect (`asc versions list --app 6782366555`), not in this file.

## Rules
- No emojis anywhere.
- Live at talli.jaybulb.com. `heyitsmejosh.com` lapsed on purpose; never reference it.
- Runs on Cloudflare Workers (`wrangler.jsonc`, `worker/index.mjs`). Deploy with `npm run deploy`. **A git push deploys nothing.**
- Storage is Workers KV (`src/_blob.js`). `web/` is served by the assets binding; only `/` runs the Worker first.
- Three tabs on every platform: Home, Status, Messages (a floating glass nav bar on Mac, Cmd-1/2/3). Settings is a sheet from the avatar. Each tab owns its NavigationStack, or toolbar items (the avatar) vanish. Tab roots have no title; the tab bar already names them. Home is one number, one line, one action, then the money tiles and calendar; the long breakdown folds under Details. Tools open as rows in an inset grouped list, never nested folds.
- Native look: Liquid Glass on 26+ via `View+Glass.swift` (`liquidGlass`, `capsuleAction`), one radius set (cards and groups 20), 48 point capsule actions, grouped background behind cards.
- Design: `web/brand.html` (live at /brand) is the kit, `brand/tokens.css` the tokens, `web/landing.css` the landing styles. Padding, margin and gap come only from the space scale (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48). Side margin 20, controls 48 tall, system font everywhere except the Home amount, which is Talli Display (`scripts/gen_font.py`, Joshua asked for a custom face 2026-10-20).
- `web/tokens.css` imports the canonical `jaybulb.com/tokens.css` and only aliases. Accent is Talli blue `#5B9BD5`. Never redeclare a colour the canonical file owns.
- The CSP lives in `web/_headers`. A new external host must be added there or the browser blocks it.
- Poll with `visibilityInterval()`, never a raw `setInterval`.

## Run
```bash
npm install
npm start      # localhost:3000
npm test       # full suite, also runs in CI
```

## Key files
- `worker/index.mjs`, `src/api.js` -- Worker entry and the API
- `src/http-scraper.js` -- BC Self-Serve login and scrape (HTTP only)
- `src/parse-messages.js` -- the message parser; `/api/mobile` serves it to every client
- `web/unified.html` -- the dashboard; `web/landing.html` -- public page
- `ios/`, `macos/`, `watchos/`, `widgets-*` -- native apps (xcodegen `project.yml`)

## Login
BCeID locks after a few wrong passwords. Never retry a failed login in a loop. Credentials for testing are in the gitignored `.env`.

## Ship
`asc workflow run ship-ios VERSION:x.y.z SUBMIT:false` builds and uploads to TestFlight without submitting for review. `ship-mac` does the Mac. Submit with `asc review submit` after checking the build. Run `asc versions list` first for the real current version.

## The loop
See `docs/LOOP-HANDOFF.md` for where things stand and the restart prompt. Open work is in `roadmap.md`.
